# Hypertension_Data_Analysis
This project analyzes hypertension data using SQL, Excel, and Power BI to explore demographics, billing, and resource use. Data, generated via ChatGPT, was cleaned and analyzed, revealing higher hypertension rates in older males and more ICU use in advanced cases, showcasing data analyticsâ€™ role in healthcare decisions.

This data analysis project aims to explore hypertension data through the use of SQL, Excel, and Power BI, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. The dataset, generated via ChatGPT for practice, covers patient demographics, disease stages, bed occupancy, billing, and insurance details. Excel was used for initial data cleaning, removing duplicates and null values, while SQL queries provided deeper insights by filtering, sorting, and querying the dataset. Power BI enabled the creation of interactive visualizations, illustrating key trends such as the prevalence of hypertension among older males and the correlation between disease stage and ICU occupancy. The analysis revealed that Stage 2 hypertension and emergency cases led to prolonged hospital stays and higher costs, with significant portions of billing covered by insurance. This project underscores the value of data analytics in optimizing hospital resources, predicting future healthcare needs, and supporting insurance providers in assessing risk. It adds practical value by showcasing how healthcare facilities can use data to enhance patient management and reduce operational costs, ultimately contributing to more efficient healthcare delivery.
